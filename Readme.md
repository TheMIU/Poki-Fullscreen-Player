# Poki Fullscreen Player

A simple fix to enable fullscreen mode for Poki games that don't support it by default. This script removes all other elements from the page and makes the game div fullscreen.

## Features

- Remove all page elements except the game.
- Make the game div take up the full screen.
- Prompt the user to enter fullscreen mode (using browser fullscreen APIs).
- Copy the script easily with the "Copy Code" button.
